# Welcome to my Blog!
## Connection to Movie or TV Show - April 18, 2019 
<b>“You either die a SpongeBob or live long enough to see yourself become a Squidward” </b> <br />
The TV show I can most relate to is by far SpongeBob Squarepants. No, it’s not because I’m a talking fish, but instead, it’s because I feel that I embody certain traits from almost all characters in that show. For example, Squidward and I are both terrible clarinet players, but we continue to play because we share a love for music. Additionally, like Squidward, I value my alone time, although I don’t have to go through extreme measures like he does to get some peace and quiet. SpongeBob is probably the worst neighbor anyone could have. <br />

Sandy Cheeks and I are also incredibly alike. We are both dedicated to positively influencing others; Sandy makes sure SpongeBob isn’t getting devoured by a bull worm, while I volunteer at the Dublin Food Pantry to make sure every member of our community has access to basic necessities. Both of us are also passionate about designing innovations that promote the common good. Sandy made a coconut milk powered car and I am developing an app that links volunteers with nonprofits. <br />

Next up we have Mr. Krabs. Although most people think of him as a greedy penny-pincher, in reality he is a genius entrepreneur. I mean who else could operate the most popular restaurant in Bikini Bottom while only having two employees, including one who paid Mr. Krabs to work there. Like Mr. Krabs I too try to be wise with my money, although I don’t have an obsessive relationship with cash like he does. My ultimate goal is to have a business as successful as the Krusty Krab one day. <br />

Surprisingly, Plankton and I also share some similarities. Plankton may be an evil, sadistic, and egotistical monster whose only goal is to rule Bikini Bottom, but he is also the most determined person I have ever seen. Plankton must have tried to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula over a million time by now, but he still continues to try. Both Plankton and I never give up on our dreams no matter how hard they might be. However, I do hope I am more successful with my plans than he was. <br />

Last but certainly not least, I relate to SpongeBob. What I love about SpongeBob is that he is pretty much always smiling even when he has a bad day, like his house being destroyed for the hundredth time. Similarly, I too try to have positive outlook on life even when things may look dire or bleak. Lastly, me and Spongebob share a common mortal enemy: cars. Let's just say both of us have crashed into our houses.
