# Welcome to my Blog!
## Connection to Movie or TV Show - April 18, 2019 
<b>“You either die a SpongeBob or live long enough to see yourself become a Squidward” </b> <br /> <br />
The TV show I can most relate to is by far SpongeBob Squarepants. No, it’s not because I’m a talking fish, but instead, it’s because I feel that I embody certain traits from almost all characters in that show. For example, Squidward and I are both terrible clarinet players, but we continue to play because we share a love for music. Additionally, like Squidward, I value my alone time, although I don’t have to go through extreme measures like he does to get some peace and quiet (SpongeBob is probably the worst neighbor anyone could have). <br />

Sandy Cheeks and I are also incredibly alike. We are both dedicated to positively influencing others; Sandy makes sure SpongeBob isn’t getting devoured by a bull worm, while I volunteer at the Dublin Food Pantry to make sure every member of our community has access to basic necessities. Both of us are also passionate about designing innovations that promote the common good. Sandy made a coconut milk powered car and I am developing an app that links volunteers with nonprofits. <br />

Next up we have Mr. Krabs. Although most people think of him as a greedy penny-pincher, in reality he is a genius entrepreneur. I mean who else could operate the most popular restaurant in Bikini Bottom while only having two employees, including one who paid Mr. Krabs to work there. Like Mr. Krabs I too try to be wise with my money, although I don’t have an obsessive relationship with cash like he does. My ultimate goal is to have a business as successful as the Krusty Krab one day. <br />

Surprisingly, Plankton and I also share some similarities. Plankton may be an evil, sadistic, and egotistical monster whose only goal is to rule Bikini Bottom, but he is also the most determined person I have ever seen. Plankton must have tried to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula over a million time by now, but he still continues to try. Both Plankton and I never give up on our dreams no matter how hard they might be. However, I do hope I am more successful with my plans than he was. <br />

Last but certainly not least, I relate to SpongeBob. What I love about SpongeBob is that he is pretty much always smiling even when he has a bad day, like his house being destroyed for the hundredth time. Similarly, I too try to have positive outlook on life even when things may look dire or bleak. Lastly, me and Spongebob share a common mortal enemy: cars. Let's just say both of us have crashed into our houses. <br />

## A Letter of Appreciation to my Mom - April 11, 2019 
Dear Mom, <br />

As the flowers start to bloom and we welcome the warmth arrival of spring, I wanted to take some time to reflect on my future and past. I know the past few months have been very hectic. You drove me from state to state so we could visit as many colleges as we could, and once decisions came out, you meticulously helped me weigh out the pros and cons for each college. But most importantly you always told me to not to worry about getting accepted or rejected because in the end I will find a place right for me. This simple sentence helped me relieve a tremendous amount of stress. I just wanted to say thank you for supporting and encouraging me throughout the college application process. I know I wouldn't have been as successful I was without you. <br />

In less than five months, I am going to embark on a terrifying journey. I’m going to leave home and go to The University of Illinois which is 500 miles away. I have never even been away from you, Dad, and Natish for let alone one week so I can’t imagine how it will feel to be gone for months on end. Something I know I will miss everyday is your amazing cooking. Thank You so much for making food that is better than anything you could find in a restaurant. I am probably going to be daydreaming about dal makhani, kadhi chawal, and khichdi while I’m eating dorm food that tastes like cardboard. <br />

But more than your cooking, what I’m really going to miss is just having you by my side. I still remember you agreeing to let me skip preschool so we could go to the library and read instead. And of course, I can never forget all of our trips to Panera Bread so I could bite into a bagel to loosen my baby teeth. You taught me right from wrong and always made sure I knew I was loved and I cannot even imagine the countless hours you spent taking care of me and just being a great friend.   <br />

Mom, I can’t thank you enough for all that you did and continue to do for me, from changing my diapers to pushing me to always to work hard in everything I do. I know we are both going to be sad when I leave for Illinois, but as you always say, everything will work out in the end.  <br />

Sincerely, <br />



Karan Sodhi

P.S. I promise to call you often.
