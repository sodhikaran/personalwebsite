# Welcome to my Blog!

## Reflection Over Project - April 25, 2019
At the start of this project, I had absolutely no idea how to create a personal website. All I knew was that a website could possibly help me get the internships I have been looking for. So I went online and decided to buy the domain karansodhi.com for $10 a year. Now that I had the domain, I had to figure out a way to actually develop it and get it up and running online. I first considered using a pre-designed website builder like Squarespace since it would be fast and easy. However, I decided against it since I would have to pay a hefty monthly fee to keep the website running and there were limited customization options. Next, I considered creating the website completely from scratch using HTML and CSS since I could use it to customize every aspect of the website. However, once I started to learn the basics of these programming languages, I realized it would take far too long for me to learn everything I needed to know to create a website from scratch. Finally, after I considered many other options, I settled on using the minimal theme on Github Pages to create my website. I chose this because it would allow me to use some HTML and CSS to customize my website while at the same time I wouldn’t have to to completely code the backend of the site. Best of all, it is completely free to host the website on GitHub so I would only have to pay the domain registration fee. Choosing how to develop my website was probably the toughest part of the project, but I <b> persevered </b> and went through all the available options until I found the solution that was best for me. <br />

My next task was to figure out how I wanted to organize my site. I decided on having 5 different sections: the home page, a blog, a list of my awards, a portfolio of my projects and a list of my extracurriculars. One thing I was very careful about was to not misrepresent myself. When I was researching about the advantages of having a personal website, I learned that employers look very negatively on applicants who lied about having impressive accomplishments. So I made sure to be completely <b> honest </b> since I want employers to see my real self not an idealized version of myself. <br />

I decided to include a blog on my website so I could build up my personal brand and differentiate myself from my competition. But more than just helping me get a job, a blog could help me vent out my emotions. Recently I read an article that said “Suppressing negative feelings only gives them more power, leading to intrusive thoughts, which makes people get even busier to keep them at bay.” By starting a blog on my website I hope to express my emotions freely and become more <b> self-aware. </b> Even if no one reads my blog it still helps to have let my emotions flow. Currently my blog posts are about personal matters but in the future I plan on including a technical side to my blog to show employers my understanding of their industry. <br />

As I created my website my ultimate goal was to demonstrate that <b> creating a personal website is a relatively easy way to get noticed by employers. </b> This has proven to be true as once I decided how I was going to develop my website the process was straightforward. Additionally, since my website went live I have noticed that the number of people that have visited my LinkedIn profile has significantly increased. With all that said, I can confidently say that having your own personal website has an overwhelmingly positive effect on your professional development.

## Connection to Song or Poem - April 25, 2019
<b>Lean On Me by Bill Withers </b> <br /> <br />
“Lean On Me” is an American soul song from the 1970s. Singer-songwriter Bill Withers wrote this song based on his experiences growing up in a West Virginia coal mining town. During tough or “lean” times, he and his neighbors would try to help each other out. <br />

The first verse is sung like this “Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow, but if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.” This verse really resonated with me. Although there are times in my life when I’m dealing with a lot of stress and worry, like last semester when I was applying to college, I try to remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that tomorrow will be a fresh start for a better day. <br />

Withers goes on to sing “Lean on me, when you're not strong, And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on, For it won't be long, 'Til I'm gonna need, Somebody to lean on.” This part of the song reminds me to always treat others with kindness and to try my best to help others in times of need, as eventually I will be on the other side. One person I will always try to be there for is my younger brother. I know that if I can set a good example now, he will support me and others during tough times in the future. <br />

The next verse is “Please swallow your pride, If I have things you need to borrow, For no one can fill, Those of your needs, That you won't let show.” I love this part of the song because I feel that too many people close themselves off to others when instead they could alleviate their problems by talking to a friend. It took me some time to learn this, but I now know that expressing your emotions to others doesn't make you weaker but it actually makes you stronger. <br />

The last verse is “If there is a load you have to bear, That you can't carry, I'm right up the road, I'll share your load, If you just call me.” This verse reminds me that there will always be someone in my life, whether it be family or a friend, that will be happy to help me out when I need it. Additionally, I try to be the friend, brother, or son that is always available to help.
  
## Connection to Movie or TV Show - April 18, 2019 
<b>“You either die a SpongeBob or live long enough to see yourself become a Squidward” </b> <br /> <br />
The TV show I can most relate to is by far SpongeBob Squarepants. No, it’s not because I’m a talking fish, but instead, it’s because I feel that I embody certain traits from almost all characters in that show. For example, Squidward and I are both terrible clarinet players, but we continue to play because we share a love for music. Additionally, like Squidward, I value my alone time, although I don’t have to go through extreme measures like he does to get some peace and quiet (SpongeBob is probably the worst neighbor anyone could have). <br />

Sandy Cheeks and I are also incredibly alike. We are both dedicated to positively influencing others; Sandy makes sure SpongeBob isn’t getting devoured by a bull worm, while I volunteer at the Dublin Food Pantry to make sure every member of our community has access to basic necessities. Both of us are also passionate about designing innovations that promote the common good. Sandy made a coconut milk powered car and I am developing an app that links volunteers with nonprofits. <br />

Next up we have Mr. Krabs. Although most people think of him as a greedy penny-pincher, in reality he is a genius entrepreneur. I mean who else could operate the most popular restaurant in Bikini Bottom while only having two employees, including one who paid Mr. Krabs to work there. Like Mr. Krabs I too try to be wise with my money, although I don’t have an obsessive relationship with cash like he does. My ultimate goal is to have a business as successful as the Krusty Krab one day. <br />

Surprisingly, Plankton and I also share some similarities. Plankton may be an evil, sadistic, and egotistical monster whose only goal is to rule Bikini Bottom, but he is also the most determined person I have ever seen. Plankton must have tried to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula over a million time by now, but he still continues to try. Both Plankton and I never give up on our dreams no matter how hard they might be. However, I do hope I am more successful with my plans than he was. <br />

Last but certainly not least, I relate to SpongeBob. What I love about SpongeBob is that he is pretty much always smiling even when he has a bad day, like his house being destroyed for the hundredth time. Similarly, I too try to have positive outlook on life even when things may look dire or bleak. Lastly, me and Spongebob share a common mortal enemy: cars. Let's just say both of us have crashed into our houses. <br />

## A Letter of Appreciation to my Mom - April 11, 2019 
Dear Mom, <br />

As the flowers start to bloom and we welcome the warmth arrival of spring, I wanted to take some time to reflect on my future and past. I know the past few months have been very hectic. You drove me from state to state so we could visit as many colleges as we could, and once decisions came out, you meticulously helped me weigh out the pros and cons for each college. But most importantly you always told me to not to worry about getting accepted or rejected because in the end I will find a place right for me. This simple sentence helped me relieve a tremendous amount of stress. I just wanted to say thank you for supporting and encouraging me throughout the college application process. I know I wouldn't have been as successful I was without you. <br />

In less than five months, I am going to embark on a terrifying journey. I’m going to leave home and go to The University of Illinois which is 500 miles away. I have never even been away from you, Dad, and Natish for let alone one week so I can’t imagine how it will feel to be gone for months on end. Something I know I will miss everyday is your amazing cooking. Thank You so much for making food that is better than anything you could find in a restaurant. I am probably going to be daydreaming about dal makhani, kadhi chawal, and khichdi while I’m eating dorm food that tastes like cardboard. <br />

But more than your cooking, what I’m really going to miss is just having you by my side. I still remember you agreeing to let me skip preschool so we could go to the library and read instead. And of course, I can never forget all of our trips to Panera Bread so I could bite into a bagel to loosen my baby teeth. You taught me right from wrong and always made sure I knew I was loved and I cannot even imagine the countless hours you spent taking care of me and just being a great friend.   <br />

Mom, I can’t thank you enough for all that you did and continue to do for me, from changing my diapers to pushing me to always to work hard in everything I do. I know we are both going to be sad when I leave for Illinois, but as you always say, everything will work out in the end.  <br />

Sincerely, <br />



Karan Sodhi

P.S. I promise to call you often.
